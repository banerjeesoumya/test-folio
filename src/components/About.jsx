        Hi there, I'm Soumya! I am a third-year student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at KIIT University. With each passing day, I thrive on to the excitement of learning and exploring new things.
        I actively engage myself in exploring new technologies and opportunities. I always dedicate myself to learn new skills; 
        currently, I am focusing and mastering on Data Structures and Algorithms while also exploring and working on projects. I enjoy interacting with like-minded people and developing new solutions.
        In my leisure time, I enjoy watching movies, web-series, listening to music and watching football.
